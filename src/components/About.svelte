<h2>About</h2>
<hr />
<p>
	I'm a game designer and programmer currently pursuing an MFA at the NYU Game Center. In addition
	to game design, I have a background in music composition and audio programming, and I dabble in 2D
	art and animation.
</p>
<p>
	I'm interested in generative and procedural systems, emergent play, experimental games, music
	games, web games, and more.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I mostly make lots of small games and prototypes, which are available on my
	<a href="https://mattmora.itch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> page.

	You can read reflections on the design and development of a few of my games by selecting the
