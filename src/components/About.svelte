<h2>About</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  I'm a game designer and programmer currently pursuing an MFA at the NYU Game Center. In addition
  to game design, I have a background in music composition and audio programming, and I dabble in 2D
  art and animation.
</p>
<p>
  I'm interested in generative and procedural systems, emergent play, experimental games, music
  games, web games, and more.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I mostly make lots of small games and prototypes, which are available on my
  <a href="https://mattmora.itch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> page.
