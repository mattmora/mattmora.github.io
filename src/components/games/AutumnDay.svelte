    Another short game I made in Prototype Studio at the NYU Game Center, the prompt that inspired <i
      >An Autumn Day</i
    >
    was to make a game "for" a classmate. It could be a game they would like, a game in their style,
    a remake of one of their games, or anything similar. I was assigned to make a game for my classmate
    <a href="https://haoliao.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hao</a> and I chose
    to attempt to emulate his style and make a sort of spinoff to a few of his games that feature a common
    character.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a quick way to start getting into Hao's visual style (and because I thought it would be
    funny), I used <a
      href="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">AssetStudio</a
    >
    to extract the sprites from a couple of Hao's games,
    <a
      href="https://haoliao.itch.io/i-want-to-hear-that-again"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">I want to hear that again</a
    >
    and
    <a
      href="https://haoliao.itch.io/there-is-a-beautiful-star"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">There's a Beautiful Star</a
    >. At that point, I also decided I would use Hao's rabbit character from those games.
  </p>
  <p>
    In terms of game design, Hao excels conveying complex and abstract emotions through simple
    controls and mechanics, which is of course a challenge to emulate, so I tried to just follow the
    structure of the two games I had taken assets from. Each one starts by establishing a simple
    task for the player and through the act of doing this task, its meaning takes form.
