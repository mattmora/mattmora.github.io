  <div class="float svelte-1d5lome" style="width: 50%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWOmR3LsuU4?si=V796O_XIp_rdRIRn" title="Video player" frameborder="2" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="svelte-1d5lome"></iframe></div>
    <p><i>Stellata Waterway</i> started as a recreation of certain systems and mechanics from one of my
    favorite games as kid (and still), <i>Klonoa 2: Lunatea&#39;s Veil</i>. Specifically, my design is
    directly based on
    <a href="https://youtu.be/6JQQhQK05SY?t=205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first phase of the game&#39;s final boss</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Making the game</h3>
  <p>I started with the space and movement system, trying to recreate aspects of <i>Klonoa</i>&#39;s
    design that I liked. One was the movement around the tunnel, which has a certain sense of
    inertia. The tunnel and camera don&#39;t immediately rotate to center the player and they don&#39;t
    immediately stop rotating when the player stops moving to the side. Another was the camera
    position, which is slightly below the tunnel&#39;s center and angled slightly downward, which
    compared to a centered and forward facing camera, as I first tried, is more readable and makes
    the space feel larger.
  </p>
  <p>But for various parts of the movement system, I chose to stray from <i>Klonoa</i>&#39;s design.
    <i>Klonoa</i> is a rather slow game which suits its tone. But I was interested in making
    something more action-oriented, so the player moves much faster than in <i>Klonoa</i>. Likewise,
    <i>Klonoa</i>
    has a midair &quot;flutter&quot; mechanic that aids slow, deliberate platforming. That didn&#39;t feel suited to
    what I was making, so I left it out. In general, as my game came together, it started to form its
    own identity and I moved away from simply recreating a reference. I did, however, arrive at a similar
    double jump system to <i>Klonoa</i>, though more organically than as a recreation.
  </p>
  <p>Coming up with the double jump system was a memorable moment to me in &quot;finding the fun&quot; in a
    system. I had implemented nearly every other mechanic in the game and while testing just
    happened to hit a star while midair. It was immediately obvious that doing so should give the
    player another jump. This mechanic became a central part of what makes the game fun and
    challenging. It&#39;s by no means an innovative mechanic (plenty of platformers including <i>Klonoa</i> feature similar mechanics), but the way I arrived at it through making and testing is a process
    I hope to repeat.
  </p>
  <p>The last thing I made was the level. As another game made in one week, making a boss or a level
    with a satisfying end seemed out of scope, so I decided to again diverge from <i>Klonoa</i> and create
    an infinite runner. I designed a basic level that could loop, added a scoring system to provide a
    clear goal, and linked the score to the player&#39;s speed as a basic difficulty ramp. There are a few
    issues with the design, such as level readability at high speed and extreme bias towards certain
    scoring strategies, but there&#39;s nothing beyond fixing and things mostly function as I&#39;d hoped.
  </p>
  <h3>Playing my own games</h3>
  <p>Of all of my games, this is the one I probably enjoy playing the most, which I don&#39;t think means
    it&#39;s better (certainly it&#39;s hard to properly enjoy narrative, puzzle, or other
    one-time-experience games as their designer, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re worse), but it&#39;s a
    valuable observation to make in developing my design process. I enjoy action-oriented games and
    I can apparently make one, at least to my own taste, yet I have rarely made such games. If I
    want to make more action-oriented games, I need to question what about my current circumstances,
    intuitions, and processes as designer might be drawing me away from doing so.
  </p>
  <p>One idea is that I often get caught up in the idea of having a higher concept or purpose for the
    game than simply to be fun. I avoided that thinking with <i>Stellata Waterway</i> because it was
    intended as just a mechanical homage. Instead of concept, I was able to focus on small features and
    interactions that I enjoyed, and I found that even without a driving concept, new and interesting
    ideas came out of the processing of making. Maybe if I want to make more games like this, I need
    to think less conceptually and just incrementally build on small features that excite me.
  </p>
  <h3>Tunnel runners</h3>
  <p class="final">Since finishing this game, I&#39;ve also enjoyed hearing what games it reminds people of. People
    have likened it to Vectrex games, a sequence in <i>Spyro the Dragon</i>, and
    <i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</i>. While none of those were on my mind when making this, it&#39;s
    interesting to see more instances of what I&#39;ve come to call &quot;tunnel runners&quot; as a relatively
    uncommon spatial system.
